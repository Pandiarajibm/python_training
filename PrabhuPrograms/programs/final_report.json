By default, Beautiful Soup stores the value(s)\nof a multi-valued attribute as a list:","77":"When you turn a tag back into a string, the values of any multi-valued\nattributes are consolidated:","78":"If an attribute looks like it has more than one value, but it's not\na multi-valued attribute as defined by any version of the HTML\nstandard, Beautiful Soup stores it as a simple string:","79":"You can force all attributes to be stored as strings by passing\nmulti_valued_attributes=None as a keyword argument into the\nBeautifulSoup constructor:","80":"You can use get_attribute_list to always return the value in a list\ncontainer, whether it's a string or multi-valued attribute value:","81":"If you parse a document as XML, there are no multi-valued attributes:","82":"Again, you can configure this using the multi_valued_attributes argument:","83":"You probably won't need to do this, but if you do, use the defaults as\na guide.

You can convert a\nNavigableString to a Unicode string with str:","86":"You can't edit a string in place, but you can replace one string with\nanother, using replace_with():","87":"NavigableString supports most of the features described in\nNavigating the tree and Searching the tree, but not all of\nthem. In particular, since a string can't contain anything (the way a\ntag may contain a string or another tag), strings don't support the\n.contents or .string attributes, or the find() method.","88":"If you want to use a NavigableString outside of Beautiful Soup,\nyou should call unicode() on it to turn it into a normal Python\nUnicode string.

The order in which the opening tags and strings are\nencountered is called document order. Beautiful Soup offers tools for\nsearching a document's elements in document order.","147":"The .next_element attribute of a string or tag points to whatever\nwas parsed immediately after the opening of the current tag or after\nthe current string. It might be the same as .next_sibling, but it's\nusually drastically different.","148":"Here's the final <a> tag in the \"three sisters\" document.

You can use them to filter based on a tag's name,\non its attributes, on the text of a string, or on some combination of\nthese.","157":"The simplest filter is a string. Pass a string to a search method and\nBeautiful Soup will perform a tag-name match against that exact string.\nThis code finds all the <b> tags in the document:","158":"If you pass in a byte string, Beautiful Soup will assume the string is\nencoded as UTF-8. You can avoid this by passing in a Unicode string instead.","159":"If you pass in a regular expression object, Beautiful Soup will filter\nagainst that regular expression using its search() method.

If you want to\npreserve mixed-case or uppercase tags and attributes, you'll need to\nparse the document as XML.","427":"UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character\n'\\xfoo' in position bar (or just about any other\nUnicodeEncodeError) - This problem shows up in two main\nsituations. First, when you try to print a Unicode character that\nyour console doesn't know how to display. (See this page on the\nPython wiki for help.)\nSecond, when you're writing to a file and you pass in a Unicode\ncharacter that's not supported by your default encoding. In this\ncase, the simplest solution is to explicitly encode the Unicode\nstring into UTF-8 with u.encode(\"utf8\").","428":"KeyError: [attr] - Caused by accessing tag['attr'] when the\ntag in question doesn't define the attr attribute. The most\ncommon errors are KeyError: 'href' and KeyError: 'class'.\nUse tag.get('attr') if you're not sure attr is\ndefined, just as you would with a Python dictionary.","429":"AttributeError: 'ResultSet' object has no attribute 'foo' - This\nusually happens because you expected find_all() to return a\nsingle tag or string. But find_all() returns a list of tags\nand strings\u2014a ResultSet object. You need to iterate over the\nlist and look at the .foo of each one. Or, if you really only\nwant one result, you need to use find() instead of\nfind_all().","430":"AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'foo' - This\nusually happens because you called find() and then tried to\naccess the .foo attribute of the result. But in your case,\nfind() didn't find anything, so it returned None, instead of\nreturning a tag or a string. You need to figure out why your\nfind() call isn't returning anything.","431":"AttributeError: 'NavigableString' object has no attribute\n'foo' - This usually happens because you're treating a string as\nthough it were a tag. You may be iterating over a list, expecting\nthat it contains nothing but tags, when it actually contains both tags and\nstrings.","432":"Beautiful Soup will never be as fast as the parsers it sits on top\nof. If response time is critical, if you're paying for computer time\nby the hour, or if there's any other reason why computer time is more\nvaluable than programmer time, you should forget about Beautiful Soup\nand work directly atop lxml.","433":"That said, there are things you can do to speed up Beautiful Soup. If\nyou're not using lxml as the underlying parser, my advice is to\nstart. Beautiful Soup parses documents\nsignificantly faster using lxml than using html.parser or html5lib.","434":"You can speed up encoding detection significantly by installing the\ncchardet library.","435":"Parsing only part of a document won't save you much time parsing\nthe document, but it can save a lot of memory, and it'll make\nsearching the document much faster.","436":"New translations of the Beautiful Soup documentation are greatly\nappreciated. Translations should be licensed under the MIT license,\njust like Beautiful Soup and its English documentation are.","437":"There are two ways of getting your translation into the main code base\nand onto the Beautiful Soup website:","438":"Create a branch of the Beautiful Soup repository, add your\ntranslation, and propose a merge with the main branch, the same\nas you would do with a proposed change to the source code.","439":"Send a message to the Beautiful Soup discussion group with a link to\nyour translation, or attach your translation to the message.","440":"Use the Chinese or Brazilian Portuguese translations as your model. In\nparticular, please translate the source file doc\/index.rst,\nrather than the HTML version of the documentation. This makes it\npossible to publish the documentation in a variety of formats, not\njust HTML.","441":"Beautiful Soup 3 is the previous release series, and is no longer\nsupported. Development of Beautiful Soup 3 stopped in 2012, and the\npackage was completely discontinued in 2021. There's no reason to\ninstall it unless you're trying to get very old software to work, but\nit's published through PyPi as BeautifulSoup:","442":"$ pip install BeautifulSoup","443":"You can also download a tarball of the final release, 3.2.2.","444":"If you ran pip install beautifulsoup or pip install\nBeautifulSoup, but your code doesn't work, you installed Beautiful\nSoup 3 by mistake. You need to run pip install beautifulsoup4.","445":"The documentation for Beautiful Soup 3 is archived online.","446":"Most code written against Beautiful Soup 3 will work against Beautiful\nSoup 4 with one simple change. All you should have to do is change the\npackage name from BeautifulSoup to bs4. So this:","447":"becomes this:","448":"If you get the ImportError \"No module named BeautifulSoup\", your\nproblem is that you're trying to run Beautiful Soup 3 code, but you\nonly have Beautiful Soup 4 installed.","449":"If you get the ImportError \"No module named bs4\", your problem\nis that you're trying to run Beautiful Soup 4 code, but you only\nhave Beautiful Soup 3 installed.","450":"Although BS4 is mostly backward-compatible with BS3, most of its\nmethods have been deprecated and given new names for PEP 8 compliance. There are numerous other\nrenames and changes, and a few of them break backward compatibility.","451":"Here's what you'll need to know to convert your BS3 code and habits to BS4:","452":"Beautiful Soup 3 used Python's SGMLParser, a module that was\ndeprecated and removed in Python 3.0. Beautiful Soup 4 uses\nhtml.parser by default, but you can plug in lxml or html5lib and\nuse that instead. See Installing a parser for a comparison.","453":"Since html.parser is not the same parser as SGMLParser, you\nmay find that Beautiful Soup 4 gives you a different parse tree than\nBeautiful Soup 3 for the same markup. If you swap out html.parser\nfor lxml or html5lib, you may find that the parse tree changes yet\nagain. If this happens, you'll need to update your scraping code to\nprocess the new tree.","454":"I renamed three attributes to avoid using words that have special\nmeaning to Python. Unlike my changes to method names (which you'll see\nin the form of deprecation warnings), these changes did not\npreserve backwards compatibility. If you used these attributes in\nBS3, your code will break in BS4 until you change them.","455":"UnicodeDammit.unicode -> UnicodeDammit.unicode_markup","456":"Tag.next -> Tag.next_element","457":"Tag.previous -> Tag.previous_element","458":"Some of the generators used to yield None after they were done, and\nthen stop. That was a bug. Now the generators just stop.","459":"There is no longer a BeautifulStoneSoup class for parsing XML. To\nparse XML you pass in \"xml\" as the second argument to the\nBeautifulSoup constructor. For the same reason, the\nBeautifulSoup constructor no longer recognizes the isHTML\nargument.","460":"Beautiful Soup's handling of empty-element XML tags has been\nimproved. Previously when you parsed XML you had to explicitly say\nwhich tags were considered empty-element tags. The selfClosingTags\nargument to the constructor is no longer recognized. Instead,\nBeautiful Soup considers any empty tag to be an empty-element tag. If\nyou add a child to an empty-element tag, it stops being an\nempty-element tag.","461":"An incoming HTML or XML entity is always converted into the\ncorresponding Unicode character. Beautiful Soup 3 had a number of\noverlapping ways of dealing with entities, which have been\nremoved. The BeautifulSoup constructor no longer recognizes the\nsmartQuotesTo or convertEntities arguments. (Unicode,\nDammit still has smart_quotes_to, but its default is now to turn\nsmart quotes into Unicode.) The constants HTML_ENTITIES,\nXML_ENTITIES, and XHTML_ENTITIES have been removed, since they\nconfigure a feature (transforming some but not all entities into\nUnicode characters) that no longer exists.","462":"If you want to turn Unicode characters back into HTML entities on\noutput, rather than turning them into UTF-8 characters, you need to\nuse an output formatter.","463":"Tag.string now operates recursively. If tag A\ncontains a single tag B and nothing else, then A.string is the same as\nB.string. (Previously, it was None.)","464":"Multi-valued attributes like class have lists of strings as\ntheir values, not simple strings. This may affect the way you search by CSS\nclass.","465":"Tag objects now implement the __hash__ method, such that two\nTag objects are considered equal if they generate the same\nmarkup. This may change your script's behavior if you put Tag\nobjects into a dictionary or set.","466":"If you pass one of the find* methods both string and\na tag-specific argument like name, Beautiful Soup will\nsearch for tags that match your tag-specific criteria and whose\nTag.string matches your string\nvalue. It will not find the strings themselves. Previously,\nBeautiful Soup ignored the tag-specific arguments and looked for\nstrings.","467":"The BeautifulSoup constructor no longer recognizes the\nmarkupMassage argument. It's now the parser's responsibility to\nhandle markup correctly.","468":"The rarely-used alternate parser classes like\nICantBelieveItsBeautifulSoup and BeautifulSOAP have been\nremoved. It's now the parser's decision how to handle ambiguous\nmarkup.","469":"The prettify() method now returns a Unicode string, not a bytestring."}}
