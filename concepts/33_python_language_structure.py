# Complete Python Programming Language Structure
# ----------------
# We can divide Complete Python Programming Language Structure into 2 parts
#########################

# ----------------
# PART-1: Python Programming Language Concepts
# ----------------
# like datatypes, if-block, for, while. functions, classes, etc
#
# Documentations:
#   https://www.python.org/
#   https://docs.python.org/3/
#
# There is 100% documentation for each and every library.
#########################

# ----------------
# PART-2: Python Libraries
# ----------------
# We have python libraries in 2 places which we can make use of it
#
# PLACE-1: Standard Libraries
#       - Few libraries are getting installed when we install python
#       - Library Location: C:\Python313\Lib
#         In our Laptop:     C:\Users\484964744\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib
#         Found with the help of enviroment variables.
#         Standard Libraries are installed as part of Python installation.
#
#       - Library Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
#           If any one is providing libraries, they must provide documentation also.
#         We have 100% documentation available for each and every library in it.
#
# PLACE-2: 3rd Party/External Libraries
#       - This MAIN/BIG repository
#       - Library Location: https://pypi.org/
#       - Library Documentation: https://pypi.org/
#       - How to install library?: Using below command
#           pip install any_library_name
#       - Library Installation Location: C:\Python313\Lib\site-packages
#           In our laptop C:\Users\484964744\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages
#           Whatever libraries we install, it will be in site-packages folder.
# 3rd Party Libraries are not installed as part of Python installation.For that we have to use pypi
#########################
# Library can be a single file or a folder.
